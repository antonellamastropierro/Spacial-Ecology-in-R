# OBJECTIVE: to observe community distribution using multivariable analysis
# for this objective we will use vegan = vegan analysis package
# vegan package is for ordination methods, diversity analysis and other functions for community and vegetation ecologists
library(vegan)

# to view all the datasets in the vegan package
data(package = "vegan")

# we want to look at data in the vegan package, specifically dune data
# Dune = Vegetation and Environment in Dutch Dune Meadows
# we can view the dune data with the following:
data(dune)

# if we want just see the first six rows
head(dune)

# to see the last six rows
tail(dune)

# DCA = detrended correspondence anaylsis
# DCA is a multivariate technique to determine how the species correspond
# decorana is the DCA function
ord <-decorana(dune)
ord
# first we want to take a look at the four axes and their lengths

# we can determine which percentage is pertaining to the first (longest) axis
# first to get the total value of all four axes
ldc1 = 3.7004
ldc2 = 3.1166
ldc3 = 1.30055
ldc4 = 1.47888
total = ldc1 + ldc2 + ldc3 + ldc4

# to get percentage of each axis
pldc1 = ldc1 * 100/total
pldc2 = ldc2 * 100/total
pldc3 = ldc3 * 100/total
pldc4 = ldc4 * 100/total
pldc1
pldc2
pldc3
pldc4

# determine the total percentage for two axes
pldc1 + pldc2
# the total percentage with axis 1 and axis 2 equal 71%, therefore we can use
# ... these two axes for analysis

# we can see the plot of how the species are distributed based on axis 1 and 2
plot(ord)
# this spatial graph shows which species prefer the proximity of other species
