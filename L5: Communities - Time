# OBJECTIVE: to observe species relationships over time
library(overlap)
# the overlap package is for temporal activity patterns of animals

# data we are going to use from the overlap package
data(kerinci)
head(kerinci)
# the data includes observed species (tiger), the zone (1), and time of day
summary(kerinci)

# we want to pull the data only pertaining to tigers
tiger <- kerinci[kerinci$Sps == "tiger", ]
tiger
summary(tiger)

# the time variable is circular since it loops, so we want to change it to linear
kerinci$timeRad <- kerinci$Time * 2 * pi
kerinci$timeRad
head(kerinci)

# now that the timeRad is added as a column, we reassign tiger to view only
# ... the tiger species with the added column
tiger <- kerinci[kerinci$Sps == "tiger", ]
head(tiger)

# plot tigers in relation to time
timetig <- tiger$timeRad
densityPlot(timetig, rug = TRUE)
