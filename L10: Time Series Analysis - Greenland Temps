# now we want to stack the photos on top of each other using the RGB
# place 2000 in red band
# 2005 in green band
# 2010 in blue band
# whichever year was the warmest, that color band will appear

# considering the center consists of more of a blue/black, this indicates that
# ... the 2010 year was the warmest
