# OBJECTIVE: the purpose of this lesson is to retrieve a spatial point dataset and plot the data
# install and load packages
library(spatstat)
# install either through Packages tab or use install.packages("spatstat")
# spatstat is a package that specializes in analyzing spatial point patterns

# we want to use one of the datasets included in the spatstat package 
# load data of one of the datasets
# data to used: bei
# bei is a dataset of tropical rainforest trees
# https://CRAN-R-project.org/package=spatstat
# because the dataset is already loaded in the package, we just have to type
# ... out it's name
bei
# typing its name gives the info of the number of points and sample area
# ... measurements

# plot data
plot(bei)
# the points are a bit messy so we want to change the size of the points
# we can do so by using the cex function
# cex = change point dimensions
plot(bei, cex=0.2)

# pch = change the data point symbol and shape
plot(bei, cei=0.2, pch=19)
# pch19 = solid circle

# we can use bei.extra to show the list of pixel images
bei.extra
#bei.extra is composed of 2 maps: elev and grad. We want to select only elev
plot(bei.extra$elev)

# change the name of the dataset
elevation <- bei.extra$elev
plot(elevation)

# other method for selecting elevation
# double brackets are used because the data is images
bei.extra[[1]]
elevation2 <- bei.extra[[1]]
plot(elevation2)
elevation2 <- bei.extra[[1]]
plot(elevation2)
