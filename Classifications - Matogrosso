# OBJECTIVE: to classify satellite images and estimate the amount of change
# we will take two images from the same location but different years to compare
# ... in regards to clusters

# download the packages needed
library(terra)
library(imageRy)

# view the files
im.list()


# select the two matogross images (1992 and 20006)
M1992 <- im.import("matogrosso_l5_1992219_lrg.jpg")
M2006 <- im.import("matogrosso_ast_2006209_lrg.jpg")

# we want to classify the images to two clusters: forested area and agriculture
# ... area/bare ground
M1992c <- im.classify(M1992, num_clusters = 2)
plot(M1992c)
# the clusters are always randomized because the starting point is always a 
# ... random pixel
# from the image 1 = bare, 2 = forest

# now make classification of the 2006 image
M2006c <- im.classify(M2006, num_clusters = 2)
plot(M2006c)
# 1 = bare ground, 2= forest

# now plot the two images side by side for comparison
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(M1992c[[1]])
plot(M2006c[[1]])
# the [[1]] is only b/c three images are being shown. once the package is
# ... reinstalled, it will be updated to show only one image, not 3

# we want to calculate the proportion of the classes in each image
# the freq function counts how many pixels pertain to each class
f1992 <- freq(M1992c)
f1992

# we want to calcuate the percentage of each class in the images
# first we calculate the number of pixels in the image uning ncell() function
tot1992 <- ncell(M1992c)
tot1992
# now to find percentage
p1992 <- f1992 * 100/tot1992
p1992
# the percentages show that forest = 83% and bare ground = 17%

#now conduct the same process for the 2006 image
f2006 <- freq(M2006c)
f2006

# we want to calcuate the percentage of each class in the images
# first we calculate the number of pixels in the image uning ncell() function
tot2006 <- ncell(M2006c)
tot2006
# now to find percentage
p2006 <- f2006 * 100/tot2006
p2006
# forest = 45%, bareground = 55%

#now we want to create a table comparing the data of the two images
# we can make a table using the data.frame function

# STEP 1: define the columns
class <- c("forest", "human")
y1992 <- c(83, 17)
y2006 <- c(45, 55)

# STEP 2: build the table using data.frame
tabmat <- data.frame(class, y1992, y2006)
tabmat


# now we want to create a graph for the class comparisons
# we need ggplot2 package to create the graphs
library(ggplot2)
pl1992 <- ggplot(tabmat, aes(x=class, y=y1992, color=class)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "white")
pl1992

pl2006 <- ggplot(tabmat, aes(x=class, y=y2006, color=class)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "white")
pl2006

# the purpose of the classification is to obtain quantitative data on ecosystem
