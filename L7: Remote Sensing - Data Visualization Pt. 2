# when the visible bands are compared to the NIR band, the correlation is
# ... lower as the NIR band is providing new information
# the histograms represent the frequency of reflectivity:
# I.E. comparing blue with green band, there are a higher amount of pixels with
# ... lower reflectivity and the frequency decreases as reflectivity increases
