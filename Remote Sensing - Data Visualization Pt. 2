# ... other, then they are hyper-correlated because they are similar and do not
# ... provide any additional information
# when the visible bands are compared to the near IR band, the correlation is
# ... lower as the near IR band is providing new information
# the histograms represent the frequency of reflectivity:
# I.E. comparing blue with green band, there are a higher amount of pixels with
# ... lower reflectivity and the frequency decreases as reflectivity increases
