# OBJECTIVE: to classify satellite images and estimate the amount of change

# download the packages needed
library(terra)
library(imageRy)

# take a look at the files in the package
im.list()

# we will be using the Solar Orbitar images
Sun <- im.import("Solar_Orbiter_s_first_views_of_the_Sun_pillars.jpg")

# we want to now classify the image based on clusters relating to the color
sunc <- im.classify(Sun, num_clusters=3)
# Sun = image to be classified, 3= number of clusters wanted

# now plot the classified image
plot(sunc)
# the image has been classified in 3 three clusters, clustered by energy (color)
# the clusters are random and there is no correlation between the number and
# ... the cluster with the highest energy
# based on the original image, we can deduce that #2 (yellow) is the cluster with
# ... the highest energy
