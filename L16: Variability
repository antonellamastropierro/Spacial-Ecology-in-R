# comparing the two images, the image with 3x3 pixel SD is very local, so there
# ... are little differences
# if you enlarge the pixels (7x7), the moving window is larger, so the results
# would show higher variability

# now to compare the original image plus the 7x7 SD

# you can tell that there is a large contrast in the top left corner of the
# ...original image (the white section) which accounts for the high variability
# ...in that area
# in relation to ecosystems, there can be a high variability in areas of 
# higher biodiversity
