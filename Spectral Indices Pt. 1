# we are working with a location of the Amazon forest and will be comparing

# we want to import the 1999 image first
im.import("matogrosso_l5_1992219_lrg.jpg")

#let's assign a name to the 1992 image
mg1992 <- im.import("matogrosso_l5_1992219_lrg.jpg")

# plot the 1992 image with the bands
# bands: 1=NIR, 2=red, 3= green
im.plotRGB(mg1992, r=1, g=2, b=3)
# based on the image, the majority consists of complete forest, with small
# ... cleared area in the southwest portion

im.plotRGB(mg1992, r=2, g=1, b=3)
# again the image depicts a dense forest with the violet showing soil

im.plotRGB(mg1992, r=2, g=3, b=1)
# water usually is black b/c it absorbs the nearIR, but b/c this river contains
# ... many soil particles, it is seen as yellow

# NOW we want to look at the 2006 image
mg2006 <- im.import("matogrosso_ast_2006209_lrg.jpg")
im.plotRGB(mg2006, r=2, g=3, b=1)
# the enhanced blue is best as the soil is yellow, making it more obvious
# the 2006 image shows a large clearance in this image
